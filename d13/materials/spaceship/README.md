Implement this so that it looks and behaves like a spaceship moving around in space (see screencast). The "up", "right", "down", and "left" arrow keys should control its movement.

See: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1402698/binding-arrow-keys-in-js-jquery

Also, make sure you don't send the spaceship out of bounds! Detect the boundaries!

## Bonus

Instead of just up right down and left, implement controls so that it also can rotate!
