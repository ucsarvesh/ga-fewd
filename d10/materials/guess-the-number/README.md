## Bonus Lab

Guess the number.

* A user is asked to guess a number between 1 - 10, inclusive. The correct number is generated randomly by the program. See:
  * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random
  * https://gist.github.com/kerimdzhanov/7529623
* When a user enters a guess, they are told whether it was correct or not.
* A user can see the total number of correct guesses they have made as well as the total number of incorrect guesses they have made.
